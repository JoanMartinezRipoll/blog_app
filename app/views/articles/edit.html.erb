<h1>Editing article</h1>
<!--
The method: :patch option tells Rails that we want this form to be submitted via the PATCH HTTP method which is the HTTP method you're expected to use 
	to update resources according to the REST protocol.
The first parameter of form_for can be an object, say, @article which would cause the helper to fill in the form with the fields of the object. 
	Passing in a symbol (:article) with the same name as the instance variable (@article) also automagically leads to the same behavior. 
-->

<!-- #this will get translated into 
	<%#= form_for :article, url: article_path(@article), method: :patch do |f| %> for the edit view
	and into 
	<%#= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>
	for the new form
	The reason is that is that @article is a resource corresponding to a full set of RESTful routes, 
	and Rails is able to infer which URI and method to use -->
